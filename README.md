## About the dataset

The [original dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SmD4-xZQLOka6_0u4NG7_nTxHRjoFr0YprUiU8PbaxU/edit?usp=sharing) was curated by volunteers from 9geek, a Discord community organized by Mr. Nuttapong Ruengpanyawut (a Member of the House of Representative from the Move Forward Party). However, the dataset in its original form contains many numerical errors that threaten the validity of subsequent analyses. For this project, I cross-checked inputs in the candidate constituency with the ThaiPBS and Election Commission of Thailand (ECT) and corrected any mismatch. For a detailed list of sanity check I performed on the original dataset, please refer to [data_check.ipynb](https://github.com/peemlerd/thai-election66/data_check.ipynb).
