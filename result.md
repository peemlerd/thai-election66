# Executive Summary


# Introduction 


Thailand held a general election on May $14$^{th}, $2023$ to elect $500$ members of the House of Representative (MP). As Thai people became increasingly frustrated with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha — who orchestrated a coup in 2014 — and his cabinet, the election was highly anticipated as a turning point towards Thailand's brighter future. The member of the 
sentatives (HR) are elected from two systems: 400 from single-member constituency (bang
ket) and 100 from party-list. The result suggested an overwhelming victory for the so-called
pro-democracy coalition (8 parties), which receives more than 74% of the votes for party-list
ballot and 312 member of parliament (MP) seats. This translates to

een observers of the country’s politics wondered whether the longtime incumbent prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha – who seized power in a 2014 coup – would be able to hang on amid growing discontent and an invigorated opposition movement. While many hoped the progressives would make ground, the results were truly stunning. Almost 40 million Thais – a national record – weighed in at the ballot box. 



Thai election is often viewed through binary lens — pro-democracy versus pro-authoritarian; progressive versus conservative; among others. I find the former pair pejorative and the latter reductionist. Since every Member of Parliament  is elected through the same electoral rules mandated by the 2017 Constitution, which criteria shall we use to determine how **authoritarian** a politician is? What makes those proclaiming to wear the mantle of democracy more democratic than others? In what ways are we progressing as opposed to moving backward? That being said, for the sake of convention, I will use the progressive-conservative lens — the lesser of the two evils — to analyze the 2023 general election result. Henceforth, 
- Conservative parties include Democrat, Chart Thai Pattana, Chart Pattana Kla, Bhumjaithai, Palang Pracharath (PPRP), Ruam Thai Sang Chart, and Thai Pukdee.
- Progressive parties include Pheu Thai, Move Forward Party (MFP), Thai Sang Thai, Prachachart, Seri Ruam Thai, Pheu Thai Ruampalang.

As the saying goes, "lens helps clarify but also distorts." It is my hope this analysis does more of the former for you.

## About the dataset

The [original dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SmD4-xZQLOka6_0u4NG7_nTxHRjoFr0YprUiU8PbaxU/edit?usp=sharing) was curated by volunteers from 9geek, a Discord community organized by Mr. Nuttapong Ruengpanyawut (a Member of the House of Representative from the Move Forward Party). However, the dataset in its original form contains many numerical errors that threaten the validity of subsequent analyses. For this project, I cross-checked inputs in the candidate constituency with the ThaiPBS and Election Commission of Thailand (ECT) and corrected any mismatch. For a detailed list of sanity checks I performed on both datasets, please refer to [data_check.ipynb](https://github.com/peemlerd/thai-election66/data_check.ipynb).
